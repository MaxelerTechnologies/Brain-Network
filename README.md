This App implements a linear correlation analysis of brain images to detect brain activity. It automatically extract a dynamic network from brain activity of slices of mice brain. It is interesting to analyse the long range interactions between the different brain hemispheres. Moreover, this should be done in real-time in order to actively collect information and to suggest action to take to the scientists.
